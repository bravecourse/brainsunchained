		<h2>Finding A School That Works For You</h2>
	<h3>When searching for a school there are a few things that you need to know. Most schools will accept a returning citizen for in-person and online classes. Just be aware of the fact that you will have to disclose your history. Be up front and honest about being incarcerated. Don't let it discourage you from seeking a higher education. It would be helpful to have things like a character letter or a letter from you parole or probation officer stating that you are on the right path.</h3>
	<h4>Other useful documents that you should have ready are things like:

	<ul>
		<li>Social Security Card</li>
		<li>Government Issued ID</li> 
		<li>Birth Certificate</li>
		<li>High School Transcript or Equivalent Degree</li></ul>
	</h4>
	<h5>If you do not have a high school diploma there are ways for you to gain the equivalent to one. Those that have a high school diploma or the equivalent to one have a better chance at getting better employment and wages. You can gain a diploma by taking The High School Equivalency Test (HiSET) exam, The General Educational Development (G.E.D.) exam, or The Testing Assessing Secondary Completion (TASC) test. Once you have completed one of these tests you can then start your journey to a post-secondary education. </h5>
