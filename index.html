		<p>--Of the 33% of formerly incarcerated people who have received their GEDs,73% were earned while incarcerated.  However, <strong>Less Than 10% </strong>of women returning to society actually follow through with higher education.<br><BR>--Less than 1% of those women actually go on to attain a college degree.<br><br>--Women returning to society are often not eligible for federal Pell Grants or students loans, making it difficult to pay for their education.<br><br> --Criminal History questions on College/Univeristy applications can also deter women returning to society from applying to colleges.<br><Br>--100% of those women will find something useful to them or someone they know on this website.<br><br>
